# Probably Interesting Data

Description: In order to understand our datasets and pick the best fitting algorithms, we must determine the estimated density. In this notebook, I use two different datasets as well as kmeans and expectation maximization to better derive possibilities.

Location: Machine Learning Graduate Course at KU

Dates: Feb 5, 2019 to Feb 18, 2019

## Goal
* Estimating the density of two data sets. 

## Data
* Prima Indians Diabetes - Nine features where most are continuous with a few discrete variables.
* Iris - All continuous variables.

## Analysis
* I performed data rangling on the two data sets (i.e., normalized features, removing unrelevant features)
* Visualized features with histograms
* Developed k-means and gaussian mixture models

## Results
* K-means can cluster the iris data set but guassian mixture models needs more tuning.
